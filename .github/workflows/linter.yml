          #  If none of them are passed, then they all default to true.
          #  If any one of the variables are set to true, we default to leaving any unset variable to false (only validate those languages).
          #  If any one of the variables are set to false, we default to leaving any unset variable to true (only exclude those languages).
          #  If there are VALIDATE_[LANGUAGE] variables set to both true and false. It will fail.
